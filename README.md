## Installation

## Usage

### Downloading a list of assets

```

```

Filename defaults to `assets.json`. `--curated` is optional, defaults to `false`;

### Downloading all assets from a list

```
node download.js {your-service-account-key.json} filename.json

- an `info.json` file containing all of the metadata generated by the `list` script
